# Repository contract checks

Three checks that enforce the machine-checkable half of this project's maintenance contracts. They run in CI
(the `lint` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on every push and pull request.

| Check | Guards |
| --- | --- |
| `strip_ce_comments.py --check` | Shipped CraftEngine configuration under `src/main/resources/craftengine/**/configuration/` carries no comments. Field references live in the wiki, not in the data files. |
| `meal_icons.py --check` | Every `configuration/meal_icons.yml` entry corresponds to a `farmersdelight_recipes` cooking-pot output, and every such output has an entry with a resolvable 16x16 texture. |
| `check_lang_keys.py` | Every language key the Java sources reference is defined in both `lang/en_us.yml` and `lang/zh_cn.yml`, the two locales stay symmetric, and no value is blank. |

All three are read-only with `--check` / `--quiet` and exit non-zero on a real problem, so no separate assertion
is needed. They need PyYAML (`python -m pip install pyyaml`).

```bash
python tools/strip_ce_comments.py --check
python tools/meal_icons.py --check
python tools/check_lang_keys.py --quiet
```

`python tools/test_meal_icons.py` checks station filtering, suffixed recipe roots and custom cooking-pot groups.
`generate-fluid-content.py` generates tank item/block definitions only; it leaves workstation recipes in
`farmersdelight_fluids/configuration/fluid_recipes.yml` untouched.

Without `--check`, `strip_ce_comments.py` and `meal_icons.py` rewrite the files instead of reporting. That is
the intended way to fix what they find; both keep existing order and only add, prune or de-comment.

## Scope

These copies are scoped to this repository. The monorepo parent directory holds workspace-level copies of the
same three tools that check every module in one pass:

* `strip_ce_comments.py` there also walks the addons' craftengine packs and the standalone packs under `packs/`;
* `meal_icons.py` there also covers the `crabbersdelight`, `brewinandchewin`, `endsdelight`, `corndelight` and
  `festivaldelicacies` namespaces;
* `check_lang_keys.py` there also checks the addons' language files and resolves the cross-module
  `<namespace>.<suffix>` key form.

The addons' packs and language files live in their own repositories, so a change here cannot affect them; the
split is what makes these checks runnable in this repository's CI at all.

## Related tools that stay workspace-level

`check_ce_symbols.py`, `check_item_names.py`, `check_corndelight_pack.py`, `check_endsdelight_pack.py` and
`audit_jar_backdoor.py` need inputs that are not in this repository (CraftEngine release jars, the original
mod's language files, the standalone packs). They stay in the monorepo parent directory's `tools/`.
