# Farmersdelight-Plugin-Pro

**English** | [中文](README.zh-cn.md)

Farmersdelight-Plugin-Pro is a Paper/Folia plugin port of **Farmer's Delight**, powered by CraftEngine. It adds crops, rich soil, cooking stations, knives, food, recipe discovery, advancements and a public API for addons.

This project is a maintained **optimization fork** of [Farmersdelight-Plugin](https://github.com/IOVEYOUMC0/Farmersdelight-Plugin). Building on the original gameplay, it focuses on performance improvements, asynchronous scheduling, Folia and new-version compatibility, recipe editing and integrations with other plugins.

Original author: HuiDu_OwO (IOVEYOUMC0). Fork maintenance and optimization: ydxc2009.

**Forever free and fully open source.** This project's published builds, all features and future updates will always be available free of charge. Third-party dependencies follow their own licensing and distribution policies.

Version 1.0.4 opens a menu from `/fd recipe edit`: choose a station and recipe group, search or page through recipes, and return to the same list when editing is finished. It also includes optional Kaleidoscope recipe-book filling, fuzzy cooking-pot recipes and a food-group editor. See the [integration and recipe guide (Chinese)](KALEIDOSCOPE-COMPAT.zh-CN.md).

Version 1.0.5 uses bStats 3.2.1 with plugin ID **34448**, registered as **FarmersDelightPro**. Standard server/plugin statistics use bStats' asynchronous transport and Folia support. Server owners can opt out globally by setting `enabled: false` in `plugins/bStats/config.yml` and restarting the server. Metrics tasks stop when the plugin is disabled.

## Features

- CraftEngine items, blocks, models, resource packs and loot integration.
- Cooking pot, cutting board, stove and skillet gameplay.
- Configurable crops, farmland, ropes, mushroom colonies and storage blocks.
- Nourishment, Comfort, food effects and recipe-book integration.
- Folia-safe scheduling and a stable `com.huidu.farmersdelight.api` addon API.
- Optional addons for Brewin' And Chewin', End's Delight, Expanded Delight, Crabber's Delight, Barbeque's Delight and Villagers' Delight.

## Requirements

- Paper or Folia 1.21.4 or newer
- Java 21 for the plugin; the Minecraft 26.3 test server uses Java 25
- CraftEngine 26.8.2 or newer (compiled against 26.9.1; 26.9.2 and 26.10-SNAPSHOT also verified on Paper 26.3)

Install CraftEngine first, then place the Farmersdelight-Plugin-Pro jar in `plugins/`. Use `/fd reload` for plugin configuration and `/ce reload` after changing CraftEngine resources.

Advancements require UltimateAdvancementAPI as a separate server plugin. `libs/` includes the optimized `2.8.1-pro.2` build and corresponding sources, verified on Paper 26.3 and Folia 26.2. This artifact includes only the 26.2/26.3 adapters; older servers need an API distribution matching their version. Other features remain available without the API. See [dependency details](libs/README.md). Resource-pack reloads force a definition resend; ordinary updates synchronize only changed nodes.

## Documentation

The complete player, server, addon and API documentation is maintained in the [FarmersdelightPluginWiKi](https://github.com/IOVEYOUMC0/FarmersdelightPluginWiKi) repository. It can be connected to GitBook through its GitHub integration.

## Building

```text
./gradlew build
```

The build resolves CraftEngine 26.9.1 from its official Maven repository; pass `-PceVersion=<version>` to compile against another release. CraftEngine 26.10 snapshots automatically enable native sleeping cooking-pot tickers at runtime; earlier releases use the existing scheduler. Unpublished snapshots can be compiled with `-PceJar=<plugin-jar>` and `-PceLibraries=<CraftEngine/libs-directory>` (the remapped runtime libraries). Addons compile against the generated API-only Farmersdelight-Plugin-Pro jar and must be checked out beside this repository.
